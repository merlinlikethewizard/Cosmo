Good morning Cosy. 
 Morning, Mom.
  It looks like a tornado took a dump in here. Clean your room.
   NEVER!!!
   Yes, Mom, whatever you say. 
    Thank you dear. I'm about to do a shop, by the way. Need anything from the store?
     BACON!
     Cookies!
     Nothing, Mom. Your love is all I need. 
   Hm, yeah, I'll get to that when I can
    Don't you try and brush me off. Clean your room NOW!
     Okay, fine. 
     It's my room, Mom, and it's my stank pod I'm curating.
     Flee this place, parasite in human garb! Ye shall feast no more on the fruits of my labor!
   You look like a tornado took a dump in here. 
    WHAT??!
     Just kidding love you Mom!
     Yeah, you heard that right, your tyrannical rule ends now, zealous she-beast. 
 Bacon.
  We don't have bacon, hon, but we do have all-natural no-preservatives gluten-free Puckered Grains cereal. 
   Literally kill me. 
    Oh, please. Have you even given Puckered Grains a TRY?
     Yes, I have, and it tastes like the torched remains of an aging sea fowl. 
     No... I guess it's worth a try.  
     No, and I never will.    
   Puckered Grains sounds great! 
    Really? Well then, I'll go fetch you a bowl! 
     Just kidding, I would sooner be force-fed my own sautéed intestines than ingest one spoonful of that swill.
     Yum! Thanks!
 Don't call me Cosy.
  Good morning, Cosmonauticus Tabernaculus Ketteridge Cane. 
   Much better.
    You just wait, when you have children...
     When I have children, I'll reward their wit, rather than punishing it. 
     When I have children, I'll show ‘em who's boss. 
     When I have children? Do I look like I could raise a kid? No, I couldn't. I'm a disaster.
   That's Mr. Cosmonauticus Tabernaculus Ketteridge Cane, SIR, if you don't mind.
    You little shit.
